Dylan Davis

For my final project I will be working alone and will be fixing and re-working my portfolio from project 2. 
I will be rearranging some content by restructuring my css grid and adding javascript elements for the drop down menu, and page anchors.
The visual style of my site will remain the same but functionality will be improved.
I intend for this project grade to replace my current grade for project 2.
